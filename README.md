# Rainbow Fluids

Thank you for checking out what is my first mod I created. 
This mod doesn't actually serve any practical purpose in the game but 
is merely there for decorative reasons. The idea for this sparked after
reading the latest 
[FFF#295](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-295)
which features the new designs for chemical plants. 
Wouldn't it be much cooler if you had the colorful smoke in all (or at
leas 24) colors of the rainbow?
