# Rainbow Fluids

Thank you for checking out what is the first mod I created. 
This mod doesn't actually serve any practical purpose in the game but 
is merely there for decorative reasons. The idea for this sparked after
reading the latest 
[FFF#295](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-295)
which features the new designs for chemical plants. 
Wouldn't it be much cooler if you had the colorful smoke in all (or at
least 24) colors of the rainbow?


## Mod Description

This mod adds 24 new fluids in 24 different spectrum colors. 
The three base colors (red, green and blue) are crafted with water and 
the science pack of the respective color. All other science packs cannot 
be crafted into colored water. The other colors are mixed by these three 
base colors and some colors need more levels of mixing than others. 
For example to get Amber you will have to mix Red and Green to get Yellow, 
then mix Yellow with red to get Dark Orange and finally mix Dark Orange again 
with Yellow to get Amber. 

All fluids that this mod adds are not used in any recipe other than mixing. 
They are currently only good as decoration.
